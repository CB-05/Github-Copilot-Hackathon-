# Github-Copilot-Hackathon-


### Problem Statement:

Create a command-line tool that accepts a city's name and returns the current weather forecast. Leverage OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and parse it using Python. Your solution should demonstrate how GitHub Copilot can help you with API usage, data parsing, and error handling.


### Solution:

We have designed a solution to create a Python command-line tool that utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API for fetching the current weather forecast of a specified city. Leveraging the capabilities of GitHub Copilot, the tool efficiently handles API usage, data parsing, and error handling. Users can input the name of a city, triggering an API request to retrieve the relevant weather data. The response is then parsed to extract the necessary information, which is finally displayed as the forecast to the user. Our solution ensures seamless handling of any potential errors that may occur during the API request or data parsing process, guaranteeing a reliable and user-friendly experience.
